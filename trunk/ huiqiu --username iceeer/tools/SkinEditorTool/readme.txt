=============================
Domino Web Access Skin Editor
=============================

This program will allow an admin to drastically change the look and
feel of Domino Web Access.

This program is designed to run locally.  You will want to restart the
HTTP server after making changes.

Once you open a Forms6.nsf (or Forms5.nsf) database, this tool will
display a list of the "skin groups".  There is a skin group for IE,
for Mozilla, and for all other browsers.  Choosing a skin group will
populate the "skins" selection control.  Select one of these "skins"
to view the HTML or CSS content.

You may now edit and save changes. The type of changes you can make are:
1. Placement of objects on the view pages
2. Placement of objects on the form pages ("new" and "edit" pages)
3. Add/Remove objects from either the view or form pages
4. Color and style of all objects on the page 
   (via CSS rules in the StyleSheet.css document)

NOTE:  Use this program at your own risk.  It is HIGHLY recommended
that you make a backup copy of Forms6.nsf (or Forms5.nsf) before
making changes.
