ScanditSDK Android Cordova Plugin incl. Demo App

This folder contains a simple sample application written by the Scandit team which shows how the Scandit SDK can be used as a Cordova plugin on Android.  

It was created to demonstrate the setup needed to use the Scandit SDK Cordova Plugin in a more complex project.


BUILD THE SCANDIT SDK CORDOVA DEMO APP IN ECLIPSE (with ANDROID SDK installed)

1. Before you start with the Phonegap/Cordova Demo project, download the free Scandit SDK for android from http://www.scandit.com and unzip it.

2. Go to File->New->Android Project in Eclipse, select "Create project from existing source", 
select this directory and click Finish.

3. Copy the libs folder from the regular Scandit SDK Android Demo project (Version 2.0.0 or higher). 
The libs folder includes the shared library libscanditsdk-android-<version>.so (in a folder called armeabi)
and the scanditsdk-barcodepicker-android-<version>.jar. 

4. Copy the res/raw folder from the regular Scandit SDK Android Demo project (Version 2.0.0 or higher) to the res 
folder of the Scandit Android plugin project.

5. Copy the cordova-<version>.jar (from the official cordova package) into the libs folder.

6. Copy the cordova-<version>.js file to assets/www

7. Add the scanditsdk-barcodepicker-android-<version>.jar to the build path.

8. Add the cordova-<version>.jar to the build path.

9. Get the app key from your Scandit SDK web account and add it to the 
window.plugins.scanditSDK.scan() call in the index.html file (under assets/www). 

10. Run the ScanditSDK Cordova Demo as an "Android Application".

Note: 

* Make sure that the compiler compabitility is set to Java 1.6 in Eclipse  (Eclipse->Preferences->Java->Compiler).



ADD THE PLUGIN TO YOUR OWN CORDOVA PROJECT

1. Before you start with the Phonegap/Cordova Demo project, download the free Scandit SDK for android from http://www.scandit.com and unzip it.

2. Copy the libs folder from the regular Scandit SDK Android Demo project. 
The libs folder includes the shared library libscanditsdk-android-<version>.so (in a folder called armeabi)
and the scanditsdk-barcodepicker-android-<version>.jar. 

3. Copy the res/raw folder from the regular Scandit SDK Android Demo project to the res 
folder of your Cordova project.

4. Copy the classes ScanditSDK.java and 
ScanditSDKActivity.java from the ScanditSDK cordova demo project 
(in the com.mirasense.cordova.scanditsdk.plugin package) into your project 
with the same package hierarchy. 

5. Copy the ScanditSDK.js file in the demo project's www folder to your project's www folder.

6. Refresh your eclipse project for the files to show up in Eclipse.

7. Add the scanditsdk-barcodepicker-android-<version>.jar to the build path.

8. Add the following line to the plugins.xml resource in the xml folder under <plugins>:
   <plugin name="ScanditSDK" value="com.mirasense.scanditsdk.plugin.ScanditSDK"/>

9. To incorporate the Scandit SDK scan screen, incorporate ScanditSDK.js in 
your own html/css/js via <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ScanditSDK.js"></script>

10. Start the scanner by calling window.plugins.scanditSDK.scan() with the following arguments:
	1. argument: function to be called when scan succeeded
	2. argument: function to be called when cancel button is pressed
	3. argument: Scandit SDK app key (available from your Scandit SDK web account)
	4. argument: customization options (listed in ScanditSDK.js)
